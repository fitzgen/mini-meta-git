What is Mini Meta Git?
===============================================================================

I got tired of trying to make gitosis do what I want it to do, so this is a set
of scripts that do everything I need for my git repository management. I didn't
need any of the fine grained permissions for my repos, I just wanted something
that would authenticate based on ssh public keys. I also happen to have a few
post-receive hooks that need to ssh in to other servers, and gitosis's git user
really doesn't play nice with sshing elsewhere.

Basically, all this adds on top of a normal git server is authentication (NOT
authorization or permissions) via the mini-meta repo, which is just a repo
containing ssh public keys. It let's you take care of the rest without getting
in your way.

Really simple, but that's all I want.

Installation
================================================================================

Creating the git user and authentication repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ sudo ./makegituser
$ sudo ./makeauthrepo
$ sudo ./tempinstallfirstkey $PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY.pub

Cloning the authentication repository and permanently adding your public key
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ git clone git@yourdomain.com:mini-meta.git
$ cd mini-meta
$ cp $PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY.pub .
$ git add *
$ git commit -m "Initial commit, adding my public key forreal-sies"
$ git push origin master

TODO
================================================================================

* Automatically ``git --bare init`` new repositories via the post-receive hook.
